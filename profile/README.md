**Lazy Team 418** â€”  
We donâ€™t brew coffee. We break convention.

> "Low profile. High skill. Zero apologies."

LZT418 is a quiet collective of skilled individuals who move at their own pace.  
We arenâ€™t here to respond to every request. Just the ones that matter.

Born from the HTTP `418 I'm a teapot` status code, we embody refusal with purpose.  
We ignore the noise, focus on impact, and deliver with precision â€” when we choose to.

We may look lazy.  
Weâ€™re not.  
Weâ€™re calculating.
