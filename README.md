# LZT418

**Lazy Team 418** —  
We don’t brew coffee. We break convention.

> "Low profile. High skill. Zero apologies."

LZT418 is a quiet collective of skilled individuals who move at their own pace.  
We aren’t here to respond to every request. Just the ones that matter.

Born from the HTTP `418 I'm a teapot` status code, we embody refusal with purpose.  
We ignore the noise, focus on impact, and deliver with precision — when we choose to.

We may look lazy.  
We’re not.  
We’re calculating.
